# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This is a famous dataset on Kaggle for the beginners.
I built classfication models using decision tree, KNN, logistic regression, and SVM to predict the diagnose result based on ten real-valued features. I used accuracy as my performance matrix.

The overall accuracy:
'Decision Tree': 0.94, 'KNN': 0.96, 'Logistic Regression': 0.98, 'SVM': 0.97kappa, and MCC. 
To provide more information on model performace, I calculated confusion matrix, classification report, AUC, kappa, and MCC and plotted the ROC curve.
